## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

After 1st Submission I have learned how to use Landmarks.

I have learned how to add box-shadow and practiced structuring the HTML. Aligning the HTML Divs.  And most importantly I have used and practicised GIT for this Challenge.

```html
  <div class="container">
    <div class="qr-container">
      <img class="qr-image" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="image-qr-code">
      <div class="qr-text">
        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
```css
      box-shadow: -2px 15px 20px 5px hsl(219, 15%, 82%);
```

### Continued development

I will be more focusing one:
- Margins
- Alignments
- Box Shadows

## Acknowledgments

Update1 : Special Thanks to Saulius @TH3RIV, who suggests me to use Landmarks, Media Queries, also Flexbox (But, i will do it later :), looks advance to me as I was just learning HTML & Css Now). 

Old : As this was my first Challenge I have taken help from mdn and w3school and that was really great.  Also, I appreciate the help of my family who supported me and given me free time to work on this challenge.
